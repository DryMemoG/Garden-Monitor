# Garden-Monitor
Monitoring a Garden through the Google Assistant and mobile 

>## Software Requirements
> You may need to install and Configurate the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/) and Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

>## Hardware Requirements
> For this project you will need to buy an Arduino Nano (It can be any Arduino board but the connections are mapped to an Arduino Nano board) and a list of Sensors: 
>* [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano)
>* [Soil Moisture Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13322)  
>* [Humidity Sensor](https://naylampmechatronics.com/sensores-temperatura-y-humedad/57-sensor-de-temperatura-y-humedad-relativa-dht11.html)
>* A Garden, or at least a few pots
>* _(Optional) A Google Home_

After you have all the requirementes complete you need to assembly all the parts using the folowing diagram (For the example I used two pots one in the roof and another one near my door. )
